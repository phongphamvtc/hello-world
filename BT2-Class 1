def sum(x, y):

## The abow code does not work but the below code works. could you please explein the reason to me?

def sum(x, y):
    sum = x + y
    if sum in range(15, 20):
        return 20
    else:
        return sum

print(sum(10, 6))
print(sum(10, 2))
print(sum(10, 12))

# For explanation, this code is to calculate the sum of 2 numbers. If Sum in the range of (15, 20) then return to 20, otherwise, return to sum
